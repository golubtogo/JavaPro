As a Quality Assurance Engineer, I aim to enhance my proficiency in Java to better fulfill my current role requirements.
My objectives include deepening my understanding of OOP, Algorithms, JUnit, and the Spring Framework.
Additionally, I seek to refine my ability to review Java code effectively.
The successful outcome of this Java Pro course will be evidenced by a reduction in the percentage of manual test cases and an expansion in test automation coverage.
I'm excited about the opportunity to learn Java and acquire new knowledge and skills :)
